    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I always seem to have leftover cooked chicken. This simple, tasty salad is
      a great use of your leftover chicken, either white meat, dark meat, or a
      combination! Romaine lettuce, cooked chicken, avocado, and cherry tomatoes
      combine with ranch dressing, and everything is topped off with crunchy
      bacon. Use purchased ranch salad dressing, or stir up one of the
      buttermilk dressing recipes on the site. Enjoy for a hearty lunch with
      some crackers, or for dinner, with a crusty bread. This recipe is
      proportioned for one person, but it's easy to double or triple for your
      needs.
